# WEATHER-DATASET-FOR-DATA-MINING
This is a university project with my group mate.
first we talk about how we collected our data from raw data .then we describe how we extracted and optimize a perfect data or sample for our research.then ,
we used Weka tools for data mining and used various algorithm (KNN,Naive Bayes and decission tree) for classification  of our dataset .after that we  choose a best algorithm based on (highest accuracy and minimum bias ) for optimal solution.then we discuss about how we deal with missing value.
we have  completed  our project with successfully under on of the renowned faculty at my university
